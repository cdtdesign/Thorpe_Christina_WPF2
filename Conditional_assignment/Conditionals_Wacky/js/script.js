// Living in the last standing house made of brick, one day the three little piggys went out for some items. How many items did they successfully bring back home?

// Number of items piggy #1 bought
var firstLittlePiggy = prompt("PIGGY #1: How many eggs did the fist little piggy buy from the market?");

// Number of items piggy #2 bought
var secondLittlePiggy = prompt("Piggy #2: \nHow many lattes did the second little piggy buy from Starbucks?");
