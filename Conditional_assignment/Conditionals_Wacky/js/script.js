// Living in the last standing house made of brick, one day the three little piggys went out for some items. How many items did they successfully bring back home?

// Number of items piggy #1 got
var firstLittlePiggy = parseInt(prompt("PIGGY #1: How many eggs did the fist little piggy buy from the market?"));

// Number of items piggy #2 got
var secondLittlePiggy = parseInt(prompt("PIGGY #2: \nHow many lattes did the second little piggy buy from Starbucks?"));

// Number of items piggy #3 got
var thirdLittlePiggy = parseInt(prompt("PIGGY #3: \nHow many flowers did the third little piggy get from the park?"));
