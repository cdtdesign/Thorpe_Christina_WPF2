// Prompt and Alert

/* var yearBorn = prompt("Enter your year of birth");
console.log(yearBorn); */

var width = prompt("We are calculating the area of a rectangle. \nPlease enter the width:");
var height = prompt("Now please enter the height:");
var area = width * height;

//console.log(area); // prints it out to the console

//alert("The area of your rectangle is " + area + " sq. feet");

//the alert just above works the same as the alert below-both are correct:
var result = "The area of your rectangle is " + area + " sq. feet";
alert(result);
